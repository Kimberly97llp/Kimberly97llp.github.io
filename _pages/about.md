About Me
--------
Hi there! My name is Kimberly Llajaruna Peralta.

My background: I am originally from Lima, Peru. I grew up for most of my life in Lima in the densest district of South America. I was lucky to obtain a scholarship to study my last 2 years of high school in a multicultural school in Costa Rica. After that experience, I moved to the USA to study my undergraduate studies.

My interests: I always been interested in creating things: my family had a woodshop and a restaurant so I been very for many things all my life. I love to work with my hands so I decided to study Mechanical Engineering and also a degree in Art. After working for a bit, I got interested in data and its many uses. As I learned later in life, you can be interested in many , many things! One main center of my efforts is to improve education for minority students though mentorship and talks (for now but I am working on some other projects related to this).

Throughout my career, I have gained experience in various domains, including Mechanical Engineering, Motion Sensing, and Data Science.
My goal: to keep learning! I get interest in many many things (currently I am thinking of ways to connect ceramics and data!) I hope to make a positive change in the world
