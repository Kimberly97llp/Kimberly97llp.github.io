title: "NLP Project: Beyond Words: Enhancing Reasoning in Entity Tracking"
excerpt: "This paper explores the impact of
fine-tuning models equipped with reasoning
capabilities on entity tracking. Leveraging a
T5-base model, we evaluate the effects of fine-
tuning via two distinct avenues: mathematical
reasoning using mathematical question-answer
pairs and computational reasoning with coding-
related question-answer pairs. The study in-
vestigates the models’ performances across in-
dividual datasets—general knowledge, code,
and math—as well as their combinations. Re-
sults demonstrate that models trained on code-
only datasets exhibit superior entity tracking
capabilities compared to general knowledge-
based models, while those trained on math-
ematical reasoning exhibit challenges due to
out-of-vocabulary symbols <br/><img src='/images/500x300_3.png'>"
